\section{False Imprisonment}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Intentional, unlawful, and unconsented restraint.
    \item \emph{Additur} and \emph{remittitur}: after jury delivers damages, judge adjusts them up or down.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Should appellate courts be allowed to issue remittances? Levy says no, because appellate courts get a thin version of the case (only transcripts, etc.) and more is needed to make an accurate determination about damages.
        \item There are generally no limits on the damages a jury can award (with a few exceptions).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Shopkeeper's privilege}: Shopkeepers can detain suspected shoplifters.
\end{enumerate}
