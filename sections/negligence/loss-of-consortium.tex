%     \item Loss of consortium: loss of love, companionshiop, society, sex, 
%     services--all because of injury to another. In CA, only a spouse can bring 
%     a loss of consortium action.
%     \item Wrongful birth: if a couple gets sterilized or an abortion, which is 
%     performed negligently: if teh child is healthy, some states do not allow 
%     recovery. in CA, one can recover for the cost of raising the child, but 
%     defendant can ask that it be reduced for the joy and benefits the parents 
%     received. levy has problems with that bc of question........ [??????]
%     \item There can also be recoery if malpracitce failed to disclose 
%     condition fo the fetus. If child is severly unhealthy, recovery can 
%     include special needed care.
%     \item wrongful life? Can a child bring its own action? yes, if it's 
%     necessary for care after the parents' death. CA does not allow recovery 
%     for pain of life, but does allow recovery for special medical care.
