\section{Transferred Intent}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Historically, transferred intent means that intent to commit any of the five traditional torts (battery, assault, false imprisonment, trespass to land, trespass to chattel) can constitute the necessary intent to commit any of the other five. 
    \item The Second Restatement only incorporates transferred intent for assault and battery.
    \item Generally, \textbf{intent towards anyone for anything is intent towards anyone else for anything else}.
    \item Does the intended target matter? \textbf{\emph{Alteiri v. Colasso}}:  The defendant threw a rock that hit the plaintiff in the eye, but he intended to scare somebody else. He did not intend to hit anyone, and he did not throw the rock recklessly. The court ruled that there was no error in the jury's verdict for willful battery.
\end{enumerate}
