\subsection{Insurer's Failure to Settle within Policy Limits}

\subsubsection{\emph{Crisci v. Security Ins. Co.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item On appeal, the real party in interest is DiMares.
    \item A prudent insurer without policy limits would have accepted the 
    settlement.
    \item When an insurance company provides a lawyer for an insured, the 
    lawyer's duty is to the insured, not the insurance company. This is the 
    rule, though it's not always followed.
    \item Barratry
    \item Champerty
\end{enumerate}
