\section{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tort law rests on three frameworks:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Fairness.
        \item Loss distribution.
        \item Law and economics.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Supremacy Clause leads to three kinds of 
    \textbf{preemption} of federal laws over state laws:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Express preemption}: A federal law explicitly or 
        implicitly overrides a state statute.
        \item \emph{Conflict preemption}: In case of direct conflict, 
        federal law preempts state law.
        \item \emph{Field preemption}: Congress legislates for an entire 
        field of regulation, leaving no room for states to regulate.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
