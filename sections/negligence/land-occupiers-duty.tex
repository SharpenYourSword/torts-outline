\subsection{Land Occupiers' Duty}

%%% PREMISES LIABILITY


%\subsubsection{\emph{Rowland v. Christian}}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item todo
% \item All land occupiers owe a duty of care to anyone on the land, with some 
% exceptions for felonious trespassers.
% \item Land occupiers should be held liable under general negligence 
% principles, not jurisprudential categories.
% \item Factors when a land occupier defendant has a duty of care to 
% plaintiff:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Duty of care exists unless policy considerations dictate 
%     otherwise.
%     \item Was the harm foreseeable?
%     \item Was there a degree of certainty of the harm?
%     \item Closeness of connection betwen p's conduct and d's harm
%     \item [Morality....?]
%     \item Policy of preventing future harms
%     \item Burden of duty rule on D
%     \item Availability of insurance
% \end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Duty is a question of law for the court.
    \item Foreseeability of harm was the most iportant question, and should go 
    to a jury. --> subsequently changed to be the court's duty
\end{enumerate}

%\subsubsection{\emph{Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center}}
%
\begin{enumerate}
%    \item todo
\item Landowner rarely owes duty to provide a security guard, unless the harm 
occurs after a similar prior incident.
\item Returns to a jurisprudence of categorization: instead of a loose 
foreseeability notion, it gave a narrow rule to be followed: was there a prior 
similar incident?
