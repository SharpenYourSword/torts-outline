\subsection{Immobility Requirement: \emph{Bletter v. Harcourt, Brace \& World, 
Inc.}}

You're allowed to dance on the job.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A high school textbooks editor was feeling good. He ``attempted to 
    do a dance step but fell and fractured his thigh.''\footnote{Casebook p.  
    657.}
    \item The workers' compensation board ``finds that claimant's casual 
    indulgence in a little dance step on the employer's premises and while in 
    a swiftly moving elevator, was not an unreasonable activity in view of his 
    feeling of well-being created by his liking for both the job and his 
    co-workers, so as to be deemed a deviation from the employment.''
    \item The court agreed with the board that employees are ``not required to 
    remain immobile.''
\end{enumerate}
